# Welcome to my blog

I am Marie Serykh and am aiming to become a Software Developer. To be precise a Front-End Developer.

I have been interested in the IT world for many years, even worked as a Project Manager in IT companies, though I did not dare to code or dream about working as a developer.

For now I have knowledge of HTML and CSS, which are not programming languages but a good start anyway. Recently I have started learning Javascript, tried to build small apps using Vue.js and I like it!

Most of all I would like to master programming concepts, algorythms, security and UX: user experience, at the end of the day everything is done for users to use :)

I am happy to share my exprience on the way with you!
