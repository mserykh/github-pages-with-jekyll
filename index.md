# Welcome to my blog

I am Marie and am aiming to become a Softwear Developer. To be precise a Front-End Developer.
I have been interested in the IT world for sometime already but I did dare to start coding and dream about working as a Developer.

For now I have some knowledge of HTML and CSS, those are not programmming language, but is a good start anyway. Recently I have started learning JavaScript and I like it!
But most of all I would like to learn and master programming concepts, algorythms, security and, of course, UX: user experience, at the end of the day everything we do is for users to use!

I am happy to share my experience with you.
